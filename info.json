Before you begin living through the quiet year, you will take turns adding some features to your currently empty map. Use crude drawings or icons on the map itself - try not to use words. Use your words instead to describe what the feature is when you pass the map to the next player. After each of you has added a feature, enter the !continue command.",

But we don’t know about that yet. What we know is that right now, in this moment, there is an opportunity to build something.*\"",
